Then choose the bitrate/quality you prefer.\r\n\r\n#### Important\r\nIf you get an \"unidentified developer\" error like this:<br>\r\n![Unidentified Developer error](http://cdn.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2012/08/Gatekeeper%20can%27t%20open_0.jpeg)<br>\r\nThen you will need to **right-click** the app and select **Open** the first time you use it. See [this article](http://www.imore.com/how-open-apps-unidentified-developer-os-x-mountain-lion) for why.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n1. Mac only. QuickTime Player X required.\r\n2. This app is not malware nor does it do anything other than stated. You can check the `/src` folder to see what code it runs, or open up the `.app` in Automator to inspect and/or tweak it yourself.\r\n3. This app does not host or provide the feeds themselves, nor is it affiliated with their providerâ€”it's simply a small wrapper for loading URLs into QuickTime.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
