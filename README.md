Watch Hockey.app
============

Watch live streams of all NHL hockey games, for free, on your Mac.

## Install / Use

Download [Watch Hockey.app.zip](https://raw.github.com/mismith/watch-hockey/master/Watch%20Hockey.app.zip), unzip, and drag into your Applications folder.

Launch it to see a list of the day's available live feeds. Then choose the bitrate/quality you prefer.

#### Important
If you get an "unidentified developer" error like this:<br>
![Unidentified Developer error](http://cdn.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2012/08/Gatekeeper%20can%27t%20open_0.jpeg)<br>
Then you will need to **right-click** the app and select **Open** the first time you use it. See [this article](http://www.imore.com/how-open-apps-unidentified-developer-os-x-mountain-lion) for why.


## Notes

1. Mac only. QuickTime Player X required.
2. This app is not malware nor does it do anything other than stated. You can check the `/src` folder to see what code it runs, or open up the `.app` in Automator to inspect and/or tweak it yourself.
3. This app does not host or provide the feeds themselves, nor is it affiliated with [their generous provider](http://dnalloheoj.com/)â€”it's simply a small wrapper for loading URLs into QuickTime.
