Watch Hockey.app
============

Watch live streams of all NHL hockey games, for free, on your Mac.

## Install / Use

Download [Watch Hockey.app.zip](https://raw.github.com/mismith/watch-hockey/master/Watch%20Hockey.app.zip) (right-click &gt; Save As&hellip;), unzip, and drag into your Applications folder.

Launch it to see a list of the day's available live feeds. Then choose the bitrate/quality you prefer.

**NB**: Mac only. QuickTime Player X required.<br>
**NB**: This app is not malware nor does it do anything other than stated. You can check the `/src` folder to see what code it runs, or open up the `.app` in Automator to inspect and/or tweak it yourself.

## Credit

This app does not host or provide the feeds themselves, nor is it affiliated with their providerâ€”it's simply a small wrapper for loading URLs into QuickTime.
